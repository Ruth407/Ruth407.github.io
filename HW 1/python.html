        <h2>What is Python?</h2>
        <p>Python is a high-level programming language that is meant 
            to be easy to read and write. It was created by Guido van 
            Rossum and first released in the 1990s. The language uses simple,
            English-like syntax so developers can understand code more easily 
            than in many other languages. Python can run on different operating 
            systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux without needing major changes 
            to the program, which makes it adaptable for many types of projects.</p>
            
        <h2> How does it work?</h2>
        <p>Python is an interpreted language, meaning the code is read and executed
                 one line at a time by an interpreter rather than being fully compiled 
                 before running. This allows programmers to test and fix code faster. 
                 Python also includes many built-in tools and libraries that help 
                 developers avoid writing everything from scratch, which speeds up 
                 building software.</p>

        <h2>Applications that use Python</h2>
            <ul>
                 <li>Web Development: Python is used to build the backend parts of websites and web apps. Frameworks like Django and Flask help handle data, user requests, and server logic.</li>
                 <li>Data Science and Machine Learning: Python is widely used for analyzing data and creating models that learn from patterns. It has many libraries designed specifically for these tasks.</li>
                 <li>Games and Graphics: Python can be used to create simple games or visual programs, especially for learning and experimenting with basic graphics.</li>
               
            </ul>
