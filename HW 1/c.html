        <h2>What is C++?</h2>
        <p>C++ is a programming language that developers use to build fast and effcient software. It was created by Bjarne Stroustruo as an extension of the earlier C language, so it look a lot like C but adds more features. One of the biggest things C++ adds is support for object-oriented programming, which lets programmers organize their code using classes and objects. This makes C++ useful fo building large, complex programs like games, operating systems and performance-heavy applications.</p>
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>C++ code does not run directly on a computer. Before it becomes a working program, the code must be translated into machine code, which is the the low-level language the computer understands. This translation is handled by a compiler. The compiler checks the code for errors, analyzes it, and converts it into a form the computer can run. After the compilation process is finished, the result is a program file that the system can open. When that file runs, the computer follows the instructions that originally came from the C++ source code.  </p>

        <h2>Applications that use C++</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Web Browsers: Parts of major browsers like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox are built with C++ so pages load quickly and run smoothly.</li>
            <li>Operating Systems and System Tools: Many low-level tools and components that manage hardware and system resources use C++ because it provides strong control and high performance.</li>
            <li>Many professional programs that need fast processing and detailed graphics, such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, are built with C++ to keep them responsive and efficient.</li>
        </ul>
