        <h2>What is Java?</h2>
        <p>Java is a programming language that developers use to make
            different kinds of software. A big reason Java is so popular 
            is because it can run on many types of devices. This makes it 
            useful for companies and large projects where programs need to 
            work the same way on different systems.</p>
            
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p> Java works by taking the code that developers write and turning it into a form that the computer can understand. Instead of running directly on the computer, Java uses something called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM basically reads the compiled Java code and makes it run the same way on different devices. This is why Java programs can work on Windows, Mac, Linux, and even phones without being rewritten.</p>
            
        <h2>Applications that use Java</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Android Apps: Many mobile apps for Android phones are built using Java because it works well with the Android development system</li>
            <li>Web Applications: Java is used on the server side of websites to handle data, users, and background processes. Large platforms use it to manage heavy traffic.</li>
            <li>Business/Enterprise Software: Companies use Java for systems that manage things like customer information, banking, inventory, and company operations.</li>
            <li>Games: Some video games are made with Java. A well-known example is Minecraft</li>
        </ul>
